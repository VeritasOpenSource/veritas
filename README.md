# VErification of open‑source Reliability, Integrity, and Technical Assurance System

## System for analyzing and verification open-source ecosystem

## Reasons:
The open source software ecosystem, by its very nature, is destined to contain problems related to integration, security, and code efficiency.

Some problems are solved by creating new languages ​​(Growth), manually searching for problems, or using analyzers.

Considering the last point, one of the problems is that in most cases, analyzers are used sparingly, when urgently needed or for other reasons.

## The concept...
...underlying this project is to view the ecosystem as a SINGLE WHOLE, where each package, its functions, and other elements are part of a single software system.

## Tasks
- Obtaining information about packages and combining them.
- Parsing them into their components.
- Determining relationships with other system elements.
- Constructing a function call graph for various packages.
 - Static analysis of individual functions within the ENTIRE ecosystem.
 - Cascade analysis of the interrelationships of identified issues and their impact on other ecosystem elements.
- Proposing changes to packages code.
